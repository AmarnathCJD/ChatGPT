# CHATGPT

`CHATGPT` is a wrapper for the `CHATGPT` model from OpenAI purely built on Golang. The application has various features, including asking questions and getting responses, remembering the context of the conversation, exporting the conversation to a file, and importing the conversation from a file. 

The app also allows users to get the conversation history, use multiple models such as `davinci`, `gpt 3`, `gpt 3.5`, and `gpt 4`. Other features include API Key Authentication, Customizable temperature of the model, Inbuilt Tokenizer for the model, and http/https proxy support for the client.
